# Welcome to Virtual Detention - Backend

#### ToolKit Summary [Full Stack Application]:
1. Full Stack Application: TensorFlow REST Framework
2. TensorFlow BERT models for Natural Language Question Answering: Answer questions based off content of a given passage, serving as a virtual tutor once ML algorithms with BERT complete deployed as RESTful API, can then integrate with React/Node.js frontend! [Typescript TensorFlow models converted to js [using tensorflow converter] and deployed as JSON RESTful API to render output to the frontend
using Tensorflow & javascript backend, with React.js & Node.js frontend.]

## ENVIRONMENT
##### ML Hardware: (optional - for metadata)
##### Coral: USB accelerator set up guide: https://coral.ai/docs/accelerator/get-started/ & https://coral.ai/docs/accelerator/datasheet/

### Deploying TensorFlow Models as RESTful API 
##### Docker - Containerize: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/02_our_app/
##### https://www.mlq.ai/django-machine-learning/

### API Documentation


### CRUD: Storing BERT output as new JSON file
###### later user authentication will allow account creating and saving answers to profile
